# 33c3

The 33th Chaos Communication Congress from December 27th to 30th, 2016

Dear lovely Rubyists,

after our first assembly at the Congress last year, we want to do that again <3

We will collect all information here in this repo.

More Infos about the 33rd CCC: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Main_Page

##Register for our Assembly at the Congress
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Assembly:Rubytown It's a bit tricky: First, you have to create a profile in the wiki and say that you are member of the Rubytown Assembly. After confirming your profile, go back to the assembly page, click on the arrow right of the star and then click "Refresh". Now you should see you name in the member list.
